# 🌍 Climate and Environmental Data Analysis Portfolio (R)

This repository contains a set of three analytical projects developed in R that explore historical climate trends, temperature variability, and the relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and surface temperature anomalies. The portfolio demonstrates applied skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical interpretation.

The projects are structured as modular analyses (Projects 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) and follow a reproducible research workflow suitable for policy analysis, environmental research, and data analytics roles.
