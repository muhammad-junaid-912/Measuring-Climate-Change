#  Climate and Environmental Data Analysis Portfolio (R)

This repository contains a set of three analytical projects developed in R that explore historical climate trends, temperature variability, and the relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and surface temperature anomalies. The portfolio demonstrates applied skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical interpretation.

The projects are structured as modular analyses (Projects 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) and follow a reproducible research workflow suitable for policy analysis, environmental research, and data analytics roles.

##  Portfolio Objectives
- Apply statistical programming in R for real-world environmental datasets.
- Visualize long-term temperature trends and seasonal variations.
- Quantify variability and distributional patterns in climate data.
- Examine the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature change.
- Demonstrate reproducible data analysis workflows and documentation practices.

#  Project 1.1 — Temperature Trend Analysis

###  Objective
To analyze long-term temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere and identify historical warming trends using time-series visualization.

###  Description
This project imports monthly temperature anomaly data and converts it into time-series objects in R. Line plots are generated to observe temperature changes over extended periods. The analysis highlights periods of warming and cooling and provides a visual understanding of climate change dynamics.

Key steps include:
- Data import and cleaning
- Time-series transformation
- Trend visualization using line charts
- Interpretation of long-term climate patterns

###  Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing
- Time-series analysis
- Data visualization
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

#  Project 1.2 — Temperature Distribution and Variability Analysis

###  Objective
To examine the distribution and variability of temperature anomalies across different time periods using descriptive statistics and histograms.

###  Description
This module focuses on understanding how temperature anomalies are distributed over time. Frequency distributions and histograms are generated to visualize variability and dispersion. Mean and variance comparisons are used to assess whether temperature volatility has increased across decades.

Key steps include:
- Histogram generation
- Frequency table construction
- Variance and mean analysis
- Comparative interpretation across periods

###  Skills Demonstrated
- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Data visualization
- Statistical interpretation

#  Project 1.3 — CO₂ and Temperature Correlation Analysis

###  Objective
To investigate the statistical relationship between atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and temperature anomalies.

###  Description
This project merges temperature and CO₂ datasets and applies scatterplot visualization and correlation analysis to quantify the association between emissions and temperature change. The analysis provides empirical evidence supporting climate change trends and environmental policy relevance.

Key steps include:
- Dataset merging and alignment
- Scatterplot visualization
- Correlation coefficient estimation
- Interpretation of environmental relationships

###  Skills Demonstrated
- Data integration
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization of relationships
- Analytical reasoning
